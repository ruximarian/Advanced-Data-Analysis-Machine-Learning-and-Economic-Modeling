# Advanced-Data-Analysis-Machine-Learning-and-Economic-Modeling

This repository contains multiple data-driven projects that integrate **supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques** for economic and financial analysis. The work focuses on **data preprocessing, statistical modeling, classification, and clustering** to extract meaningful insights from economic indicators.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The main objectives of this project include:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing large economic datasets  
- Performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions  
- Applying **unsupervised learning techniques** for feature extraction  
- Implementing **supervised learning models** for predictive analysis  
- Conducting **economic impact assessments**  

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Techniques Used  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing & EDA  
âœ” Handled missing values and applied normalization techniques  
âœ” Performed **descriptive statistics and correlation analysis**  
âœ” Visualized data using **scatter plots, boxplots, histograms, and biplots**  

### ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning  
âœ” **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Factor Analysis** for dimensionality reduction  
âœ” **Clustering techniques** (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to segment economic data  

### ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning  
âœ” **Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification tasks  
âœ” Model evaluation using performance metrics  

### ðŸ”¹ Economic & Financial Analysis
